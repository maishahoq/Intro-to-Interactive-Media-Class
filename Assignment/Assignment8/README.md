#### Inspiration 

When the small led bulb lit up for the first time, my brain went back to the 'Eureka' moment with a flashing light bulb that's used in cartoons. 
And the original 'Eureka' moment was a discovery, so I used a book, when opened, the light of knowledge lights and when closed, the bulb dims down to a stop.
